# Bayesrel
R-Package "Bayesrel" provides both Bayesian and frequentist internal consistency estimates

The package provides the most common internal consistency estimates, being: 
    Coefficient Alpha, Guttman's Lambda-2/-4/-6, greatest lower bound and Mcdonald's Omega. 
    The Bayesian estimates are provided with credible intervals. The method for the Bayesian estimates 
    is sampling from the posterior inverse wishart for the covariance matrix based measures, and 
    gibbs sampling from the joint conditional distributions of a single factor model in the case of Omega.
