Title: Bayesian Reliability Estimation
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Julius Pfadt and Don van den Bergh
Maintainer: Julius Pfadt <julius.pfadt@gmail.com>
Description: So far, it provides the most common single test reliability estimates, being: 
    Coefficient Alpha, Guttman's lambda-2/-4/-6, greatest lower bound and Mcdonald's Omega. 
    The Bayesian estimates are provided with credible intervals. 
    The method for the Bayesian estimates is sampling from the posterior inverse Wishart for the covariance matrix based measures.
    Gibbs Sampling from the joint conditional distributions of a single factor model in the case of omega.
